    <p>For a little background, I’ve been really drawn to physicality in a lot of my projects, but I don’t feel like I can really give people a good sense of the book digitally. I’ve also noticed that I try to create a sense of permanence online as if it were a book. I have about ten browsers open all packed with different tabs because I’m afraid I’ll lose the information in them forever. It strikes me that this experience is somewhat like forcing the web to act like a book.</p>

  </div>

    <div class="column-two" id="one">
    <p>For some background, I have been working commercially for over 10+ years. I was a construction worker before that. I began my career working in advertising for companies such as: Coca-Cola, Jack Daniel's, Dow Chemical, Valspar Paint, Keds, and Discover Card to name just a few. From that point, I moved client-side for several companies in many industries such as: Furniture, Ad Tech, Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Art, Culture, and Cannabis to name just a few. My personal art practice has always been to the opposite side of this commercial work.<br> <br>I began making books during art college in Chicago and Colorado. From the time I was very young, I had always enjoyed books: the texture of the paper, the smell, the physical nature of holding a book. This always made sense to me. I had an amazing teacher in school who opened up the notion of the book as an idea, not simply an object. One of those early projects was to make a graphic interpretation of works from Jorge Luis Borges. From that time I have always made books as a way to explore ideas.</p>

  <div class="column-one" id="qu-two">
    <p>Do you have any thoughts about the user’s experience of a book as opposed to a website? Do you think there is some fundamental difference between the two, and how does that affect the way we tell stories through these different modes?</p>
  </div>

   <div class="column-two" id="two"> 
    <p>The question of a book vs. a website is very timely. I also work on many digital projects from websites to apps, digital advertising, experiential digital experiences, etc. To me, these expressions are equally important. The differences are primarily physical and textural. But to share an idea through whichever format is justified. I have myself been moved by both, the final expression of a work is merely a vehicle for the intention of the work.</p>

<div class="column-one" id="qu-three">
  <p>What are the practical difficulties you face in showing a book on the web, either through instagram or your website? </p>
</div>

<div class="column-two" id="three">
  <p>I have participated in book fairs in 4 countries, over the last 5 years. The United States, Canada, China, and the United Arab Emirates. Showing a book online is certainly different from in person, but both can reach the same audience. I have a very direct approach to documenting books. Once a project is finished it is scanned, cropped, and formatted to a background color of white, black, or grey. Occasionally I will photograph a book in different ways, which is always related to the nature of that concept.</p>
</div>

<div class="column-one" id="qu-four">
<p>I also saw that you participated in Printed Matter’s Virtual Art Bookfair. Was this experience different from your standard experience of showing books online?</p>
</div>

<div class="column-two" id="four">
  <p>This year is the first I have done virtual book fairs, and I have done 3. They are in my opinion not very effective. As a participant, it is amazing to have the time to see all the books, but as a visitor, it feels very overwhelming. Many of my friends have shared the same sentiment. I do welcome a post covid world where we can see each other in person and share. I don't join these fairs to make money only, but to extend the works, meet people, and share ideas. They are amazingly fun! And tiring.</p>
</div>


<div class="column-one" id="qu-five">
<p>Has the way we are using the web, especially during COVID, affected your practice of book design or how you think about books?</p>
</div>


<div class="column-two" id="five">
  <p>Covid has not changed my own practice in many real ways. My partner and I had already made most of our own meals at home, worked together and from home. My daytime work has changed in the sense that I no longer go into a consistent office. But I also work for several companies at once, so in terms of the museum I work for, I do floor walk-throughs with the curatorial staff every couple of weeks as projects begin and finish.<br> <br>Making books to me is similar to anyone making a journal. I follow the process and it follows me. I see things and react to them. I will probably always make books as it allows me to explore things that I can not in other projects. Many of them are never sold or seen by anyone other than myself or my partner. Books are also greatly economical. I have made paintings for many years and they require adequate storage to work on. Whereas I can document the same 50 paintings, format them into a book, at a fraction of the cost or size.</p>
</div>

<div class="column-one" id="qu-six">
<p>Are there any book designers/books that really inspire you?</p>
</div>




  <div class="column-two" id="six">
  <p>Inspiration is everywhere. The sky, the air, the trees, love, hate, joy, or anger. Awareness is not something we do, it’s what we are. Constantly looking, sensing, experiencing. Every day is an inspiration. I see no real separation between work and life, they each inform each other.</p>
