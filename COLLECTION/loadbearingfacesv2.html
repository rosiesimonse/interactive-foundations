<h1>What am I looking at?</h1>
<p>Recently, I feel like a digital being. I think we all do a little bit these days. I have so many tabs open all the time. I keep opening them and opening them and opening them and opening them. When the tabs start to get really small, the kind of small that makes me afraid I'm accidentally going to close one when I try to click on it, I minimize the window. I have like twelve windows open right now. I'm afraid to close any of them. If I just keep them open maybe someday I'll be the kind of person who spends time looking at them. Maybe they have the answers that I don't. Tabs are the versions of myself that I wish that I was. How do I live with this? I am not who I want to be. Maybe that explains why I act the way I do.</p>

  <p>I have these images of statues that hold up buildings. I think they're funny. Maybe it's the notion of a statue holding up a building, maybe it's that some of them look like they are in pain. I don't know, but it strikes me that there is some strange analogy here. Tabs have no weight, but I still feel burdened by them. These statues are not important to the structual integrity of the building, but they feel the weight all the same. </p>

<h3>If you don't like it, get lost.</h3>
